# Julia-Codes
This repository is used to store some julia codes I write maybe for <br>
(1) convenience of my research or   <br>
(2) fun. <br>

It includes the basic types and the necessary functions for the construction of the functions only used by myself. <br>
For other functions associated with the three types, see the link: https://github.com/nebneuron/Simplicial

The basic three types included are  <br>
(1) SimplicialComplex, <br>
(2) CombinatorialCodes,and <br>
(3) FiltrationOfSimplicialComplexes. <br>

The inventory of the functions will be added later. <br>
